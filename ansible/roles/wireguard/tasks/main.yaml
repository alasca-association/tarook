          This task fails because we changed the handling of the wireguard key of the gateway.
          The key is now stored locally in the inventory and not on the gateways.
          To avoid voodoo synchronization, manual intervention is required.
          1.) Copy the private wireguard key file of the gateway (/etc/wireguard/wg_gw.key) to your local inventory {{ etc_dir }}/wg_gw_priv.key.
          2.) Remove the key file (/etc/wireguard/wg_gw.key) from all gateways.
          3.) Re-run the playbook
          This task is only relevant for existing clusters.

          This task fails because the private wireguard key of the gateway should no longer be stored in plain text in the file system of the workstation.
          Previously the key was not included in the git repository to mitigate the risk of leaking sensitive credentials.
          The role didn't warn you about a missing key, however, but overwrote it happily. Mercy on those who do not use '--diff'.
          We're using pass to store the credentials from now on. Here is what to do:
          1.) Fetch the current wireguard private key of the gateways. Likely spots are:
            - inventory/.etc/wg_gw_priv.key
            - /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf (on the gateways)
          2.) If you haven't done so already, install `pass` on your workstation. (https://www.passwordstore.org/)
          3.) Insert the key into the database: `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR="$(pwd)/inventory/.etc/passwordstore" pass insert wg_gw_key`
          4.) Compare the output of `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR="$(pwd)/inventory/.etc/passwordstore" pass show wg_gw_key`
              with the current wireguard private key of the gateway and make sure that they match.
