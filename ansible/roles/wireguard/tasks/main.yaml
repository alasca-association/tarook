          This task fails because we changed the handling of the wireguard key of the gateway.
          The key is now stored locally in the inventory and not on the gateways.
          To avoid voodoo synchronization, manual intervention is required.
          1.) Copy the private wireguard key file of the gateway (/etc/wireguard/wg_gw.key) to your local inventory {{ etc_dir }}/wg_gw_priv.key.
          2.) Remove the key file (/etc/wireguard/wg_gw.key) from all gateways.
          3.) Re-run the playbook
          This task is only relevant for existing clusters.
