        We're at an advanced stage of the rollout,
        but the node did not get bootstrapped yet!
        Please ensure the k8s-core/bootstrap playbook
        is executed at least once against every node
        before proceeding.
        This is automatically done if the install-all
        playbook of either k8s-core or k8s-supplements is executed.
