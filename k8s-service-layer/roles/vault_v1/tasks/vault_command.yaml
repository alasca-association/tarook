- name: Fire a vault command
  # The goal of this surprisingly complex expression is avoid any appearance of the token in the `cmdline` of the vault cli process.
  # We cannot interact directly with the vault API via HTTP because port forwarding to the orchestrator ain't easy.
  # The inner expression reads and exports the VAULT_TOKEN from stdin. The value for stdin is provided directly to the command module.
  # We checked for leaks via the following probe:
  # `sudo bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_exec*{ printf("pid: %d, comm: %s, args: ", pid, comm); join(args->argv); }'
