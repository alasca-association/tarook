- name: Fail if OpenStack application credentials are used
  when: lookup('env', "OS_AUTH_TYPE") == "v3applicationcredential"
  fail:
    msg: >
      thanos does not support OpenStack application credentials for authenticating against
      a SWIFT endpoint yet. This task was added so you don't have to wonder and search through
      the logs if thanos (and prometheus as a consequence) don't come up properly. For more
      information take a look here (https://gitlab.com/yaook/k8s/-/issues/436#note_873556688).

      That leaves you with two options:

      1. Fall back to OpenStack `v3password` based authentication if you need thanos.
      2. Disable thanos (`use_thanos = false` in config.toml) if you don't need thanos.

      If things have changed in the meanwhile, please file an issue to the LCM and get rid
      of this error message :)
