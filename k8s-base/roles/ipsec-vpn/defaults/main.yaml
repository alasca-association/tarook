# NOTE:
# This is a pragmatic workaround. The k8s API configuration has been moved
# to stage3 (refer !392). Therefore, the k8s_apiserver_frontend_port is not
# available in stage2. Because IPsec is not tested in the CI, we did not
# notice that !392 breaks this role (ref #373).
# Future developers should consider splitting the IPsec setup and
# configuration like it has been done in !392 and during the inventory
# refactoring (ref global-monitoring-frontend preparation role (tombstone MR)).
# Maybe that would be a cleaner solution.
