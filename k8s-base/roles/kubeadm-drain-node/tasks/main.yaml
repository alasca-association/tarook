# 'kubectl drain' refuses to drain nodes with pods that use local storage 
# (i.e. volumes of type emptyDir). An emptyDir has the same lifespan as a pod.
# Hence, if the pod is deleted, so is the emptyDir volume. hostPath is apparently
# not affected because the file remain on the node. "Fix" is to effectively 
# delete local storage by passing '--delete-local-data' to the kubectl cmd.
# IMPORTANT: this is something we have to inform the customer of!
