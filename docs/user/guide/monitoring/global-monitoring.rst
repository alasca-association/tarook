Global Monitoring
=================

Global monitoring refers to the possibility to monitor the health status
of your yk8s-cluster from the outer world, e.g. by connecting it to a
monitoring cluster.

.. note::

    This functionality is operator-specific
    and will be factored out of yaook/k8s soon.
