Fix non-gpu clusters

For non-gpu clusters, the roles containerd and kubeadm-join would fail,
because the variable has_gpu was not defined. This commit changes the
order of the condition, so has_gpu is only checked if gpu support is
enabled for the cluster.

This is actually kind of a workaround for a bug in Ansible. has_gpu
would be set in a dependency of both roles, but Ansible skips
dependencies if they have already been skipped earlier in the play.
