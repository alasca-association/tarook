Fix tool ``tools/assemble_cephcluster_storage_nodes_yaml.py`` to produce
valid yaml.

The tool helps to generate a Helm value file for rook-ceph-cluster Helm
chart. The data type used for encryptedDevice in yaml path
cephClusterSpec.storage has been fixed. It was boolean before but need to
be string.
