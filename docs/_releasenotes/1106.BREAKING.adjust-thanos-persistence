Adjust configuration for persistence of Thanos components

Persistence for Thanos components can be enabled/disabled by setting/unsetting
``k8s-service-layer.prometheus.thanos_storage_class``. It is disabled by default.
You must adjust your configuration to re-enable it. Have a lookt at the configuration template.
Furthermore, volume size for each component can be configured separately.
