Dropping the ``on_openstack`` variable from the ``[k8s-service-layer.rook]`` section

Previously, this was a workaround to tell rook if we're running on top of OpenStack or not.
With the new repository layout that's not needed anymore as the ``on_openstack`` variable is specified
in the hosts file (``inventory/yaook-k8s/hosts``) and available when invoking the rook roles.
