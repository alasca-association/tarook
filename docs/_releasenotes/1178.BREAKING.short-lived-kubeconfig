We now use short-lived (8d) kubeconfigs

The kubeconfig at ``etc/admin.conf`` is now only valid for 8 days after creation (was 1 year). Also, it is now discouraged to check it into version control but instead refresh it on each orchestrator as it is needed using ``tools/vault/k8s-login.sh``.

If your automation relies on the kubeconfig to be checked into VCS or for it to be valid for one year, you probably need to adapt it.

In order to switch to the short-lived kubeconfig, run

.. code:: console

    $ git rm etc/admin.conf
    $ git commit etc/admin.conf -m "Remove kubeconfig from git"
    $ ./managed-k8s/actions/k8s-login.sh
