The VIP port IP address and the gateway port IDs are now added to the
ch-k8s-lbaas configuration (``./k8s-supplements/ansible/roles/ch-k8s-lbaas-controller/templates/controller-config.toml``)
which is required as we re-introduced OpenStack security groups and in especially
needed in OpenStack environments which use OVN.

From now on, ch-k8s-lbaas must know the OpenStack port id for its configuration.
The port id is added to the hosts file by Terraform.
Terraform therefore has to be triggered once and the ch-k8s-lbaas setup must be updated.

The ``migrate-to-release.sh``-script takes care of all the necessary steps:

.. code:: console

  $ bash managed-k8s/actions/migrate-to-release.sh

.
