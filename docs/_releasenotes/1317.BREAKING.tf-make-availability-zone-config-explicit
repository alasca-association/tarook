YAOOK/k8s Terraform does not implicitly assign availability zones anymore
if actually none where set.

For all master and controller nodes,
availability zones must now be configured explicitly;
and ``[terraform].enable_az_management`` has been removed therefore.

Not configuring availability zones,
now leaves the choice to the cloud controller
which may or may not select one.
To achieve the same effect for gateway nodes,
turn off ``[terraform].spread_gateways_across_azs``.

.. attention:: Action required

   To prevent Terraform from unneccessarily rebuilding master and worker nodes,
   you must determine the current availability zones of your nodes
   and set them in the config accordingly.
