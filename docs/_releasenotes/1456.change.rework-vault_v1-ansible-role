The Prometheus integration with Vault has been updated to use a long-lived periodic token.

To activate this change, the Vault policy must be updated.

Follow these steps:
- Retrieve the root token from the Vault instance running within Kubernetes.
- Write the root token to the file etc/vault_root_token in the cluster repository.
- Execute the following command to complete the process:

.. code::

    ./managed-k8s/actions/apply-k8s-supplements.sh install-vault.yaml
