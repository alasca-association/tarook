The Vault S3 backup configuration must be moved to Vault.

Inserting the Vault S3 backup config into Vault can be automated by
storing the configuration at ``config/vault_backup_s3_config.yaml``.
Please check the documentation on how to create a configuration.

**You must update your Vault policies to import the configuration
and then triggering the ``apply-k8s-supplements.sh`` script to apply
the change**

** A root token must be sourced**

.. code:: console

    $ bash managed-k8s/tools/vault/init.sh
    $ bash managed-k8s/tools/vault/update.sh $CLUSTER_NAME
    $ AFLAGS="--diff -t vault" bash managed-k8s/actions/apply-k8s-supplements.sh

.
