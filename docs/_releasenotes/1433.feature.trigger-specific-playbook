A rework has been done which now allows to trigger a specific playbook of k8s-core or k8s-supplements.
The default behavior of triggering ``install-all.yaml`` has been preserved.
See :ref:`apply-k8s-core.sh <actions-references.apply-k8s-coresh>` and
:ref:`apply-k8s-supplements.sh <actions-references.apply-k8s-supplementssh>`
for usage information.
