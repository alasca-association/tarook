The Kubernetes root CA key is not cleared from the control plane anymore
when ``[kubernetes.controller_manager].enable_signing_requests=true`` is set in the config. (!1201)
Due to the security implications this has to be explicitly enabled.

Kubernetes root CA keys can now be backed-up in Vault's key value store
in order to enable the LCM to restore Kubernetes' ability to respond to certificate signing requests.
For newly generated Kubernetes cluster CA keys this is done automatically when
``[kubernetes.controller_manager].enable_signing_requests=true`` is set.
