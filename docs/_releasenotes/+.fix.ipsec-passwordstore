ipsec: Include passwordstore role only if enabled

The ipsec role hasn't been fully migrated to vault yet and still depends on the passwordstore role.
If ipsec is not used, initializing a password store is not necessary.
However, as an ansible dependency, it was still run and thus failed if passwordstore hadn't been configured.
This change adds the role via `include_role` instead of as a dependency.
