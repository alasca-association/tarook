The Wireguard MTU is now conditionally set on the server and on the client side.
For clients, it is clipped to a maximum of 1492 which is the maximum of a usual DSL connection.

It is recommended to update the Wireguard client templates by executing:

.. code:: console

  $ AFLAGS="--diff -t wireguard" bash managed-k8s/actions/apply-prepare-gw.sh

.
