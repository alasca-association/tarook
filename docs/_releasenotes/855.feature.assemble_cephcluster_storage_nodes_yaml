Add tool to assemble snippets for CephCluster manifest

Writing the part for the CephCluster manifest describing which disks to be used for Ceph OSDs and metadata devices for every single storage node is error-prone. Once a erroneous manifest has been applied it can be very time-consuming to correct the errors as OSDs have to be un-deployed and wiped before re-applying the correct manifest.
