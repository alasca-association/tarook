Some :doc:`environment variables </user/reference/environmental-variables>` have been removed.

``WG_USAGE`` and ``TF_USAGE`` have been moved from ``.envrc`` to ``config.toml``.
If they have been set to false, the respective options ``wireguard.enabled`` and
``terraform.enabled`` in ``config.toml`` need to be set accordingly.
If they were not touched (i.e. they are set to true), no action is required.

``CUSTOM_STAGE_USAGE`` has been removed. The custom stage is now always run
if the playbook exists. No manual action required.
