We now provide an opt-in regression fix
that restores Kubernetes' ability to respond to certificate signing requests.

Using the fix is completely optional,
see :doc:`/user/guide/kubernetes/restore-certificate-signing-ability`.
for futher details.

**Action required**:
As a prerequisite for making the regression fix functional
you must update your Vault policies by executing the following:

.. code:: shell

    # execute with Vault root token sourced
    ./managed-k8s/tools/vault/init.sh

.
