YAOOK/k8s Terraform does not implicitly assign
nodes to availability zones anymore
if actually none was configured for a node.

For all master and worker nodes,
availability zones must now be configured explicitly;
and ``[terraform].enable_az_management`` has been removed therefore.

Not configuring availability zones,
now leaves the choice to the cloud controller
which may or may not select one.
To achieve the same effect for gateway nodes,
turn off ``[terraform].spread_gateways_across_azs``.

.. attention:: Action required

   To prevent Terraform from unneccessarily rebuilding master and worker nodes,
   you must run the migration script.
   This will determine each nodes' availability zone in the Terraform state
   to set in the config for you.

   .. code::

       ./managed-k8s/actions/migrate-to-release.sh
