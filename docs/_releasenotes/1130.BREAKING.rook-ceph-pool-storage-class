Fix disabling storage class creation for rook/ceph pools

Previously, the ``create_storage_class`` attribute of a ceph pool was a string which has been
interpreted as boolean. This has been changed and that attribute must be a boolean now.

.. code:: toml

  [[k8s-service-layer.rook.pools]]
  name = "test-true"
  create_storage_class = true
  replicated = 3

This is restored behavior pre-rook_v2, where storage classes for ceph blockpools
didn't get created by default.
