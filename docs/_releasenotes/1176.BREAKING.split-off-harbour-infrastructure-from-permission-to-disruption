Added the `MANAGED_K8S_DISRUPT_THE_HARBOUR` environment variable. (!1176)

Disruption of harbour infrastructure is now excluded from `MANAGED_K8S_RELEASE_THE_KRAKEN`.
To allow it nonetheless `MANAGED_K8S_DISRUPT_THE_HARBOUR` needs to be set instead.
(See documentation on environment variables)

Ultimately this prevents unintended destruction of the harbour infrastructure
and hence the whole yk8s deployment
when `MANAGED_K8S_RELEASE_THE_KRAKEN` must be used,
e.g. during Kubernetes upgrades.
