Fix Prometheus stack deployment

If ``scheduling_key`` and ``allow_external_rules`` where set,
rendering the values file for the Prometheus-stack failed due to wrong indentation.
Also the ``scheduling_key`` did not take effect even without
``allow_external_rules`` configured due to the wrong indentation.
