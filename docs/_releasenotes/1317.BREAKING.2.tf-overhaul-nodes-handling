The format of the ``[terraform]`` config section changed significantly.

Terraform nodes are now to be configured as blocks of values
rather than across separate lists for each type of value.

.. code:: diff

     [terraform]

   - masters = 2
   - master_names = ["X", "Y"]
   - master_flavors = ["M", "M"]
   - master_images = ["Ubuntu 20.04 LTS x64", "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x64"]
   - master_azs = ["AZ1", "AZ3"]
   + #....
   +
   + [terraform.masters.X]
   + flavor   = "M"
   + image    = "Ubuntu 20.04 LTS x64"
   + az       = "AZ1"
   + #....
   +
   + [terraform.workers.A]
   + flavor   = "S"
   + image    = "Debian 12 (bookworm)"
   + az       = "AZ3"
     #....

.. attention:: Action required

   You must convert your config into the new format.

   .. code:: shell

      ./managed-k8s/actions/migrate-to-release.sh
