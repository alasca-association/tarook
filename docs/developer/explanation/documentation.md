# Documentation

The documentation is created with
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
and structured according to the
[Di√°taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/).
[Furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo)
is used as theme.

It makes use of several extensions.
Documents can either be written in the
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html)
or [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
markup syntax.
[Sphinx multiversion](https://holzhaus.github.io/sphinx-multiversion/)
is used for versioning.
